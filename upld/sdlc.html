            What is SDLC?
        </h1>
        <p>
            Software Development Life Cycle, SDLC for short, is a well-defined, structured sequence of stages in software engineering to develop the intended software product.
        </p>
        <h2 id="one">
            SDLC Activity
        </h2>
            SDLC provides a series of steps to be followed to design and develop a software product efficiently. SDLC framework includes the following steps:

                <img src="img/sdlc.png" alt="SDLC steps" style="height: 250px; width: 250px;">
                <figcaption>SDLC Steps</figcaption>
            </figure>
        <h2 id="two">
            Communication
        </h2>
        <p>
            This is the first step where the user initiates the request for a desired software product. The user contacts the service provider and tries to negotiate the terms,submits the request to the service providing organization in writing.
        </p>
        <h2 id="three">
            Requirement Gathering
        </h2>

        This step onwards the software development team works to carry on the project. The team holds discussions with various stakeholders from problem domain and tries to bring out as much information as possible on their requirements. The requirements are contemplated and segregated into user requirements, system requirements and functional requirements. The requirements are collected using a number of practices as given -
        <ul>
            <li>studying the existing or obsolete system and software</li>
            <li>conducting interviews of users and developers</li>
            <li>referring to the database</li>
            <li>collecting answers from the questionnaires.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="four">
            Feasibility Study
        </h2>
        <p>
            After requirement gathering, the team comes up with a rough plan of software process. At this step the team analyzes if a software can be designed to fulfill all requirements of the user, and if there is any possibility of software being no more useful. It is also analyzed if the project is financially, practically, and technologically feasible for the organization to take up. There are many algorithms available, which help the developers to conclude the feasibility of a software project.  
        </p>
        <h2 id="five">
            System Analysis
        </h2>
        <p>
            At this step the developers decide a roadmap of their plan and try to bring up the 
            best software model suitable for the project. System analysis includes 
            understanding of software product limitations, learning system related problems 
            or changes to be done in existing systems beforehand, identifying and addressing 
            the impact of project on organization and personnel etc. The project team analyzes 
            the scope of the project and plans the schedule and resources accordingly.
        </p>
        <h2 id="six">
            Software Design
        </h2>
        <p>
            Next step is to bring down whole knowledge of requirements and analysis on the 
            desk and design the software product. The inputs from users and information 
            gathered in requirement gathering phase are the inputs of this step. The output 
            of this step comes in the form of two designs; logical design, and physical design. 
            Engineers produce meta-data and data dictionaries, logical diagrams, data-flow 
            diagrams, and in some cases pseudo codes.             
        </p>
        <h2 id="seven">
            Coding
        </h2>
        <p>
            This step is also known as programming phase. The implementation of software design starts in terms of writing program code in the suitable programming language and developing error-free executable programs efficiently.
        </p>
        <h2 id="eight">
            Testing
        </h2>
        <p>
            An estimate says that 50% of whole software development process should be tested. Errors may ruin the software from critical level to its own removal.Software testing is done while coding by the developers and thorough testing is conducted by testing experts at various levels of code such as module testing,program testing, product testing, in-house testing, and testing the product at userâ€™s end. Early discovery of errors and their remedy is the key to reliable software development.
        </p>
        <h2 id="nine">
            Integration
        </h2>
        <p>
            Software may need to be integrated with the libraries, databases, and other program(s). This stage of SDLC is involved in the integration of software with outer world entities
        </p>
        <h2 id="ten">
            Implementation
        </h2>
        <p>
            This means installing the software on user machines. At times, software needs post-installation configurations at user end. Software is tested for portability and adaptability and integration related issues are solved during implementation.
        </p>
        <h2 id="11">
            Operation and Maintenance
        </h2>
        <p>
            This phase confirms the software operation in terms of more efficiency and less errors. If required, the users are trained on, or aided with the documentation on how to operate the software and how to keep the software operational. The software is maintained timely by updating the code according to the changes taking place in user end environment or technology. This phase may face challenges from hidden bugs and real-world unidentified problems.
